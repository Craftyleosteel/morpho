\hypertarget{classes}{%
\section{Classes}\label{classes}}

Classes are defined using the \texttt{class} keyword followed by the
name of the class. The definition includes methods that the class
responds to. The special \texttt{init} method is called whenever an
object is created.

\begin{lstlisting}
class Cake {
    init(type) {
        self.type = type
    }

    eat() {
        print "A delicious "+self.type+" cake"
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Objects are created by calling the class as if it was a function:

\begin{lstlisting}
var c = Cake("carrot")
\end{lstlisting}

Methods are called using the . operator:

\begin{lstlisting}
c.eat()
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{self}{%
\subsection{Self}\label{self}}

The \texttt{self} keyword is used to access an object's properties and
methods from within its definition.

\begin{lstlisting}
class Vehicle {
  init (type) { self.type = type }

  drive () { print "Driving my ${self.type}." }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{super}{%
\subsection{Super}\label{super}}

The keyword \texttt{super} allows you to access methods provided by an
object's superclass rather than its own. This is particularly useful
when the programmer wants a class to extend the functionality of a
parent class, but needs to make sure the old behavior is still
maintained.

For example, consider the following pair of classes:

\begin{lstlisting}
class Lunch {
    init(type) { self.type=type }
}

class Soup < Lunch {
    init(type) {
        print "Delicious soup!"
        super.init(type)
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The subclass Soup uses \texttt{super} to call the original initializer.
